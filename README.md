### Injection POC
- ``amdxx64.dll`` & ``nviapi64.dll`` Are both whitelisted DLL's, that roblox allow's to be loaded therfore you can use ``SetWindowsHookExA``
-  Another method of injection is ``Cert Spoofing``, Spoofing the Cert to any Whitelisted DLL's Cert, Require's a REG edit though to allow fake cert's
-  Rename any DLL to ``amdxx64.dll`` or ``nviapi64.dll`` and in boblox.py change the ``DLL_PATH`` & ``DLL_CALLBACK``
